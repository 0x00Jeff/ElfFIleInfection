on success the infector returns 0, otherwise it returns one of the follwing values (refer to the source code for a list of the actual values of each macro):

ERR_BAD_USAGE
	argc was less than 3

ERR_BAD_OPEN
	a failure encountered in sys_open syscall

ERR_BAD_FSTAT
	a failure encountered in sys_fstat syscall

ERR_EMPTY_FILE
	either the pivot file or payload file are empty

ERR_NOT_TARGET
	the pivot file is not a 32 bit elf with little endian architecture

ERR_BAD_MMAP
	a failure encountered is sys_mmapp_pgoff syscall
	
ERR_INFECTED
	the pivot file is already infected

ERR_NO_SHELL
	the pivot file is stripped

ERR_NO_MARKER
	the payload file doesn't have a 0x69696969 DWORD

ERR_NO_XL_SEG
	couldn't file a segment that is both executable and loadable, this shouldn't be returned except for weird files that was manually modified, if you get this error while normal executable files please contact the devolopper

ERR_NO_GAP
	no gap was found, either the payload is too big, or the pivot has really small gaps (like the 32 bit version of /bin/ls), this should happen a lot while trying to infect small. however a new infector will be uploaded here soon which should solve this problem in most cases, the only solution for now is re-try with a smaller payload


this was put here to provide and ABI after turning this code into a position independent one and use it with a loader or so, however I won't be doing this any time soon if I did it at all, you're very welcome to help
