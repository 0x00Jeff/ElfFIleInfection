- document the undocumented routines next time I edit the code
- rename elf.s to payload.s and apply the change to the readme file and the gif, also add instructions on how to assemble it as well
- make a better demo.gif
- re-check error paths (except for open's and unmap's, those are working just fine) e.g go the debugger, make eax = -1 after each routine call and see if the infecter would segfault duo to some bad stack cleaning or not clean the resouces that it should be cleaning ( e.i calling close() and unmap() ) 
- optimize the original infecter 
- write a 64 version
- figure out a way to make it support both 32 and 64 elf files without writing every routine twice
- make it position indepedent then get rid of the null bytes (probably won't do this one)
