- change next4: label with a more meaningful name (smtg like copying_shell:) next time I edit the code
- document the undocumented routines next time I edit the code
- change the the 2nd "copying shell" in output to someting else next time I edit the code then update the demo.gif
- re-check error paths (except for open's and unmap's, those are working just fine)
- optimize the original infecter 
- write a 64 version
- figure out a way to make it support both 32 and 64 elf files without writing every routine twice
- make it position indepedent
